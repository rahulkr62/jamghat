            The daycare centre – <strong>Aangan</strong> – was started in 2008. Since then, we have been working directly with
            the most vulnerable street children through this centre. Streets are not a safe place for children, and Aangan
            provides an option for parents where they can send their children without worry.

          <h3><mat-icon>warning</mat-icon> Why Aangan is Important</h3>
          <p>
            When children are on the streets, they are prone to various forms of exploitation, harassment, and addiction.
            Aangan Daycare Centre at Daryaganj remains open from 10 AM to 6 PM, Monday to Saturday.
