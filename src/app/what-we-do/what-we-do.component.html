        <p>
          The daycare centre – Aangan – was started in 2008. Since then, we have been working
          directly with the most vulnerable street children through this centre. Streets are not a
          safe place for children, and Aangan provides an option for parents where they can send
          their children without worry.
        </p>

        <p>
          When children are on the streets, they are prone to various forms of exploitation,
          harassment, and addiction. Aangan Daycare Centre at Daryaganj remains open from
          10 AM to 6 PM, Monday to Saturday.

          We organize stage and street plays on various socio-economic issues and conduct
          theatre workshops. Jamghat’s director and theatre artist, Amit Kumar Sinha,
          conducts these workshops for participants including schools, colleges, NGOs, and

          We also conduct Night Walks for the general public, students, and enthusiasts to
          expose them to the real situation of homelessness and generate support.
