          Children’s Homes – AMAN & AANCHAL
        </h3>

        <p>
          <strong>AMAN</strong> was a residential home for 16 boys and <strong>AANCHAL</strong> for 13 girls.
          These homes provided a safe, family-like space where children and youth could live and
          attend school, supported by Jamghat’s staff and volunteers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The care model included provision of basic necessities such as food, shelter, and healthcare,
          with priority on education, capacity building, recreation, and adult support and guidance.
        </p>

        <p>
          More than <strong>100 children</strong> have passed out from these two homes and are now doing
          well in their lives, contributing to society as responsible citizens.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jamghat decided to discontinue running these two CCIs. Aman Home was closed on
          <strong>31st July</strong>, and Aanchal Home is scheduled to be closed by
          <strong>31st March 2025</strong>.

          Ekjut – Livelihood for Women with Environmental Sustainability
        </h3>

        <p>
          Jamghat’s 15 years of experience showed that livelihood opportunities for women can pave
          the way for a better future for themselves and their families, thereby addressing the
          economic issues that often push children to run away from their homes.
        </p>

        <p>
          In partnership with its long-term donor and partner <strong>iPartner India</strong>, Jamghat
          developed a model to tackle both environmental degradation and poor living conditions
          of street women.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Ekjut</strong> was a tailoring unit at Jama Masjid aimed at addressing the problem of
          plastic use by training street women to make cotton cloth bags. These bags were then
          sold to a cloth manufacturing company under a <strong>100% buy-back scheme</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          These carry bags were made by women who might otherwise be begging on the streets or
          involved in exploitative sex work. Every bag sold not only reduced plastic usage but also
          provided a woman with <strong>wages and dignity</strong>.
